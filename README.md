  ## This is a project from week 9 of the Georgia Tech web development course.  It allows users to create a professional README as a markdown file.  Users need to enter the title, description, license, installation instructions, usage, credits, testing instructions, and GitHub username and profile link.  The project uses Node.js, npm packages(fs and inquirer), and user input to create the README file.
